2,In-house vs. Outsourced QA: The Showdown,Greetings enthusiast! We see that you are keen to know about in-house quality assurance and outsourcing. But before jumping right into it let us first understand the essence of Quality Assurance (QA). QA is one of the key parts of web application development which helps to deliver an error free product and gives your application a green signal. This is the point where you do not want to hurry things up it being so crucial but this is the exact point where your In-house QA team starts to bumble. Hang on here until the very end and your own intellect will pull you out of the orthodox dull path and lead you through the contemporary way called Outsourcing.  Know the difference between Checking and Testing: Checking and testing are two closely related but distinct terms that people often confuse to be of the same meaning. Checking is the process of confirming or validating whereas testing is a process of investigation learning and detection of bugs. Checking is a quality assurance process while testing is not. Checking needs time which is what your in-house QA team is spending most of the time doing as a result of which the time frame for testing is narrowed down and the product obtained is of low grade. Don’t you think having an out source for checking your product would be handy and free of negligence and full of diligence? We say hiring Outsource would allow you to be assured of an application with utmost efficiency.  A penny saved is a penny earned: You would need to hire QA team and pay them like any other full time employee when the actual QA job can be finished in a certain timespan. If you outsource your QA from our company you could hire our bona fide QA personnel in an hourly rate which will save you from spending a hefty amount of money.  Time to save time: With few in-house QA people the pace is really slow. Recruiting a large number of QA staff at your workplace would be chaotic and cost you a lot. Eventually you will opt for outsourcing them for the better.  Getting rid of all your in-house QA personnel is not what we are suggesting: For a day to day operation you can have the in-house QA personnel. They will have the first hand overview. But they are not the people you would want to depend upon at the peak hours as they won’t have a broad proficiency. Outsourced QA team come in a range of expertise they do not make blunders and are always on time. Outsourcing is a Win – Win in any situation. You wouldn’t want to risk would you?  Outsourcing helps to focus on other bits that need attention: Steve Mezak an expert in software outsourcing solutions and a member of Forbes Technology Council once quoted “You outsource to get a proven software development process so you can focus on your own core competency “. Need we say more?  SURSA TECHNOLOGY: Now coming to our company we provide a service by outsourcing our QA team in order to check the quality of IT industry in any domain.

4,The Metaverse – Simplified,The digital presence of people places and things have been reconceptualized with a multitude of ideas being integrated into the artificial reality day by day. What was once a fantasized concept for tech enthusiasts has recently been a topic of interested eyes and minds since this very digital environment has been encapsulated as the next big thing. With Facebook rebranding itself as Meta and Mr Zuckerberg betting the company’s future onto the concept the idea of artificial reality going mainstream is spiking interest in all areas imaginable.  The term metaverse was first coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel “Snow Crash” where the concept was considered to be science fiction. Since then digitally crafted reality has made its way into gaming streaming and hangout platforms all while gradually seeping into every minute second of our lives. Entire businesses have stemmed from a concept that sounded as rash as it could when it was first envisioned. It would not be wrong to consider the metaverse a parallel world allowing for seamless integration of the online and the physical world. Socializing for instance is no longer limited to cafes near you but can be done through virtual social platforms like Roblox and Fortnite. In over a few decades or so Google maps may no longer function on a phone; rather it might be enunciated by an augmented reality where a pair of hi-tech goggles will figure out where you’re looking and which turn to take next. You might turn your head upon noticing a familiar cafe and the goggles will show you its menu and public reviews. Exciting isn’t it? The younger generation has begun expecting a large portion of their lives to function in the metaverse. It’s best for the rest of us to get on board as well.  Metaverse seeks to incorporate the virtual world where users can connect as avatars of their own for activities including work hangouts and entertainment. When the tech giant Facebook rebranded as Meta Zuckerburg seemed hopeful in believing that this form of internet existence could within a decade or so replace the internet as we know it. “The next platform and medium will be an even more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience not just looking at it and we call this the metaverse” he said.  The whole world of the metaverse is a simulation accessible with a pair of headsets strapped to one’s face. It’s a fusion of virtual reality(VR) and augmented reality (AR). In an interview with Wired this year in January Philip Rosedale described the metaverse as a 3D internet populated with live people. Many have even begun making a living for themselves designing artificial accessories assets and even pets and selling them in the virtual marketplace to which surprisingly these artists found that the ones who bought them viewed it as a real thing in the world. In this regard it would not be wrong to consider that the metaverse could double out as a product or a service. Corporate meetings could be held online and the meta “mates” could hang out in scenarios of their choice and actually see a virtual self of one another. The users will literally be in the space in their own individuality and functioning as real people in the real world.  For a promising and seamless experience however the hardware and software that are in use today would also demand a significant upgrade of quality and processing speeds. Experts claim that the current reliability and technical performance should increase by over a thousand times for the whole world to practically operate online. This eventual paradigm shift also comes with its own setbacks especially when many online crimes are still on the rise with the version of the internet we have in operation today. Issues regarding phishing identity theft scamming etc. can only become more persistent in nature given the virtual world’s brand new existence.  The regulations to make this ultimate virtuality a part of our physical reality needs significant consideration regarding the governing aspect which would play a vital role in maintaining usability and decency for all those in the metaverse. While the quest of turning this virtual dream into reality persists and top tech companies like Facebook (previously) and Microsoft seem to be operating on the same team scepticism regarding the idea also tags along. A loss of $200 billion dollars for Meta while working on the idea also points towards a probable lack of resources to turn the vision into reality anytime soon. But hey this could be the start of a technological revolution too. After all if you try to do anything for the very first time you’ll do it worse – only for history to thank you for that. The setbacks and requirements will be identified along the way and eventually a concept that seems so far-fetched today could be the need for time in the long run.
5,UI/UX Trends for 2022,Last year’s trends help us speculate the changes we may have in the future. The UI/UX designs have had a significant hold on how things are supposed to be. With over 1.9 million active websites on the internet right now the scene is massively competitive in terms of gaining and retaining the visitor’s attention. It is a given for these technological shifts to happen since society is dynamic and the way we think are bound to shift with time. Today finding ways to reflect the present world in the technical trends is a theme that seems to be ongoing at large.  Generally design (and actions too) speak louder than words. It is what keeps your audience attracted and motivated to stay and take a look around. It is the first thing a visitor notices. Given that we’d want our design elements to work in sync with each other while making usability smooth and pleasing to the eyes.  The world has over the past two years sought balance between socializing and solitude. We’ll dive into the balance that user interface seems to have in store for the year ahead: Adaptive UIs That Allow for Dark-light Switching Dark is the new good in terms of design trends for 2022. While usability personalization and pleasantries always top the list of importance for users upfront designers have found a way to embrace the dark side and it has remarkably taken away all the spotlight. From system UIs and applications coming up with the dark mode pre-built in it it is undoubtedly a go-to move. Dark matte black may not be the option though. Darker shades of already dark colors are peeking from the horizon. In this regard dark/light switching might become a part of new features for various platforms as developers try to find ways to keep navigation contrasts and usage issues at bay regardless of the time of the day.  Increased Use of Chatbots Businesses are shifting online entirely and the corporate world has seen a surge in remote working opportunities and thriving off of it. The pandemic did give away some form of closure regarding the use of office spaces as automation and digitization seek to keep it that way for the years ahead. Regardless of the shift customer service still holds a lot of significance leading to a requirement of a promising presence of a quick and accessible mechanism to answer any queries they may have. Online customer service especially chatbox have seen a tremendous rise in its inclusion on company sites with numerous establishments from diverse sectors aiming to develop their chatbots alongside the attempt of reducing real-time customer services.  All-in-one Products The ‘all-services-under-one-roof’ concept has overflown into the world of technology as well and is no longer limited only to retail outlets. There is a massive boost in the concept of “one-stop” product offerings for the consumers. For instance Instagram is no longer just a photo-sharing platform. It boasts live streams reels shops DMs and so much more. The end-users are more likely to be able to avail all these services under a single login and enjoy seamless convenience as they connect with the world. It has also given rise to so many startups utilizing multiple platforms as such to reach more accounts and build an online presence.  Minimalism All the Way With “one-stop” product offerings being on the rise and reflected on company apps and sites it is of utmost importance to ensure clean interfaces to keep the user base interested in their services. A cluttered website or an app with too many tabs and buttons is only a recipe for a drop in user experience which may also translate to a bad conversion ratio for your company. Taking this into consideration the year ahead is certain to see a focus on minimalism with little of the crazy stuff in terms of visuals. White spaces and prominent display of relevant information swiftly segregated into similar tabs will seemingly be the standard. Neon colours and heavy imagery however may be used to accessorize the digital space a little – intentionally for sure to spark an interest in an area on the site.  A Potential VR/AR Boost AR and VR have always been around. But with artificial reality taking a grip and branching out into all sectors these past years AR and VR can have significant growth too. Corporates are actively carrying out meetings online and discussions are being done across the globe. And with the metaverse being on the hype and showing promising ways of becoming a whole new world in itself virtual and augmented reality sees limitless possibilities to expand. Gaming with Pokemon Go was apparently only the tip of the iceberg. Having a world with your digital miniatures in it is the next big thing. And AI AR and VR have a lot to contribute for that to happen.  E-commerce E-commerce is bustling now more than ever. Whole shops are being integrated online and we’re all here for it. Taking the complexities of quality check on 2D images online as you shop technology now seeks to upgrade the game with a 3D design that will allow users to have a 360 degree look to access quality and design in a minute perspective. Attention to detail is going to have its fanbase with corporations that will enjoy teasing us with a 3D render of product launches in real-time. Designers are more than willing to go beyond just the X and Y axes. Software optimization development of equally capable hardware and rapid improvement of semiconductor production has made even low-end devices capable of handling 3D technology like never before. We ought to bring the most out of this.  Self-design Sites for Websites Deciding on the user interface is no longer limited only up to the designers. Platforms like Wix Squarespace etc. have been on the rise allowing the end-users to directly design sites with the visuals they seek for. Given the simplicity and ease of access low-code and no-code software platforms are thriving and will continue to do so in the years to come. To make the most of this however industry knowledge and familiarity with backend processes will go a long way.  Micro Animations and Parallax Effect Parallax effects and scrolling will become a visual boosting element that will help tell stories and draw the visitors in. UX writing is sure to hold utmost importance alongside strong typography and animated elements. This will create an excellent user interface as information with a touch of creativity is sure to go a long way in keeping the visitors coming back.
